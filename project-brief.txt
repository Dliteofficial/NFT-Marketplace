- This is a NFT Marketplace. 

- The scope of the project is to build a marketplace where people can list and buy NFTs. 

- These NFTs could either be the Native NFT or some other NFT. 

- The lister will be able to list their ERC721 tokens for either MATIC or ERC20 tokens (accepted token). 

- This project will also incorporate oracle data feed to get how much will be paid in real time. 

- A user can pay for the NFT using MATIC or any of these 3 tokens: USDC (stablecoin), AAVE and ATOM. 

- We are building all of these with contract security in mind as well.
